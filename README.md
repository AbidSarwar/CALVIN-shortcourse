# CALVIN Summer 2020 Shortcourse

This is a short course intended for those who are interested in large-scale water optimization modeling with CALVIN model. Some basic optimization knowledge, especially linear programming, is assumed. This crash course introduces basics of CALVIN model with Pyomo modeling environment. CALVIN is a large-scale hydroeconomic optimization model for California, aiming to optimize water allocation to users. CALVIN is the same model as CALVIN but modeled in a different environment employing different solvers. It is an integrated model with surface and groundwater representation, covering California's most water and water-related economic activities.

## HOBBES database

HOBBES database hosting CALVIN network data. Database includes California's water infrastructure data (capacities, network properties etc) and hydrology data (inflow, groundwater etc.)

## CALVIN network tools

CALVIN network tool is used to export water network matrix of California from HOBBES database in a format that CALVIN python version can read.
