# CALVIN-PyVIN_shortcourse
This is a short course intended for those who are interested in large-scale water optimization modeling with PyVIN. Some basic optimization knowledge, especially linear programming, is assumed.This crash course introduces basics of PyVIN model with Pyomo modeling environment. PyVIN are large-scale hydroeconomic optimization models for California, aiming to optimize water allocation to users. PyVIN is the same model as CALVIN but modeled in a different environment employing different solvers. It is an integrated model with surface and groundwater representation, covering California's most water and water-related economic activities.
